    HERE ARE VALUABLE NOTES:

•Every time your web browser requests a page, the web server sends a numbers of 
headers before it sends the actual page markup. These headers are normally 
invisible, although there are a number of web development tools that will make 
them visible if you're interested. The headers are important, because they tell 
your browser how to interpret the page markup that follows. The most important 
header is called Content-Type, and it looks like this:
    Content-Type: text/html
text/html is called the "content type" or "MIME type" of the page. This header 
is the ONLY thing that determines what a particular resource truly is, and 
therefore how it should be rendered.

•HTML5 is not a big thing; it is a collection of individual features.
